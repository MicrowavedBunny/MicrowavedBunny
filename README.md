- ðŸ˜„ About me: Hi, my name is Jacob Davidson. I am 24 and I live in North Carolina. I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer and Information Science with a Major in Software Development. I have been passionate about computers from a very young age and have always wanted to pursue a career in the software development field, more specifically the game development field. I have always dreamt of one day creating something that will make at least one person's life a little bit better and make them smile. Many video games have made a lasting impact on my life and I am to one day create something like that for others.
